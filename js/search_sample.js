        "bio": "Dr. Knight has been practicing general dentistry since 1988 when she graduated from Baylor College of Dentistry ranking sixth in a class of ninety-nine. She worked part-time and paid her way through professional school. After graduation she entered the U.S. Air Force Dental Corps as a Captain and served three years of active duty during Desert Storm and three more years as a reservist. While serving the first year at Bolling AFB in Washington, D.C. she successfully completed a General Practice Residency, a competitive post-graduate program. She also completed tours of duty at Osan AB-Republic of Korea, Bergstrom AFB-Austin, Tindle AFB-Florida, and Howard AFB-Panama. In 1992, Dr. Knight started her private dental practice in Austin, which has been growing ever since. She is committed to lifelong learning through continuing education and has completed over 600 hours of post-graduate coursework and lectures. Her professional memberships include the American Dental Association and the Academy of General Dentistry.\n\nDr. Knight is a native Texan born in Houston, 1955. She graduated from high school as salutatorian in Euless, Texas, 1973, and then attended college at Trinity University, San Antonio, and Texas A&M University, Galveston. She has a Bachelor of Science degree in Marine Biology and graduated magna cum laude from TAMU. Following graduation she worked for Shell Development Company in Houston for seven years in spectroscopy and liquid chromatography labs before entering dental college.\n\nDr. Karen A Knight is married to her wonderful husband, Gerald Clay, who she first met as her dental patient when he had a toothache! After a root canal treatment and crown they found true love. (We know this is a weird way to meet but it worked for her.) She has traveled extensively and enjoys gardening, music, theater, pets, and other hobbies. Her local church, St. John’s United Methodist Church, is like an extended family and provides an outlet for worship, cultural events, and community service. Practicing dentistry is very demanding physically and so, Dr. Knight stays in shape with daily exercise and Yoga practice."

After dental school, he returned to the town where he was raised and has been in practice there for over 50 years. As a child and young adult, I remember hearing my dad’s stories about his patients, and learned how important his patient relationships were to him.\n\nObviously, he did much more than take care of their teeth. Patients would come to him for support and advice about many aspects of their lives. They trusted his guidance, and relied on his compassionate ear. I recall that he had one teenage patient who would intermittently pretend to have a toothache just so he could see my dad. \n\nMy dad is 80 years old and is still in practice. I hope to be able to provide care for patients as long as he has. There is no job more rewarding than being able to care for patients throughout the course of their lives. It is a privilege to travel alongside them on their journey, to help them through their challenges, and to share their joys.  \n\nI graduated from Tufts School of Medicine in 2000, after which I served four years in the U.S. Navy. My husband and I relocated to Maine in 2006.\n\nWe have two children, Anna and Billy, and we love all that Maine has to offer."
